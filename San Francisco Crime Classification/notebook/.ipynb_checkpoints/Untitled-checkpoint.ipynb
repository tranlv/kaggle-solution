    "###Predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay\n",
    "\n",
    "From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. Given time and location, you must predict the category of crime that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also encouraging you to explore the dataset visually. What can we learn about the city through visualizations like this Top Crimes Map? The top most up-voted scripts from this competition will receive official Kaggle swag as prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "##[Evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/details/evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each incident has been labeled with one true class. For each incident, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities (one for every class). The formula is then,\n",
    "\n",
    "logloss=−1N∑i=1N∑j=1Myijlog(pij),\n",
    "logloss=−1N∑i=1N∑j=1Myijlog⁡(pij),\n",
    "\n",
    "where N is the number of cases in the test set, M is the number of class labels, loglog is the natural logarithm, yijyij is 1 if observation ii is in class jj and 0 otherwise, and pijpij is the predicted probability that observation ii belongs to class jj.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submitted probabilities for a given incident are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1−10−15),10−15)max(min(p,1−10−15),10−15).\n",
    "\n",
    "###Submission Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You must submit a csv file with the incident id, all candidate class names, and a probability for each class. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header and should look like the following:\n",
