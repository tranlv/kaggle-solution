    "###Use Google's Word2Vec for movie reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial competition, we dig a little \"deeper\" into sentiment analysis. Google's Word2Vec is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient. This tutorial focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a challenging subject in machine learning. People express their emotions in language that is often obscured by sarcasm, ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very misleading for both humans and computers. There's another Kaggle competition for movie review sentiment analysis. In this tutorial we explore how Word2Vec can be applied to a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning has been in the news a lot over the past few years, even making it to the front page of the New York Times. These machine learning techniques, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and made possible by recent advances in computing power, have been making waves via breakthrough results in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks. Recently, deep learning approaches won several Kaggle competitions, including a drug discovery task, and cat and dog image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will help you get started with Word2Vec for natural language processing. It has two goals: \n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Natural Language Processing: Part 1 of this tutorial is intended for beginners and covers basic natural language processing techniques, which are needed for later parts of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning for Text Understanding: In Parts 2 and 3, we delve into how to train a model using Word2Vec and how to use the resulting word vectors for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since deep learning is a rapidly evolving field, large amounts of the work has not yet been published, or exists only as academic papers. Part 3 of the tutorial is more exploratory than prescriptive -- we experiment with several ways of using Word2Vec rather than giving you a recipe for using the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these goals, we rely on an IMDB sentiment analysis data set, which has 100,000 multi-paragraph movie reviews, both positive and negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Acknowledgements\n",

       "'\"With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i\\'ve started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again. Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ\\'s feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m\\'kay.<br /><br />Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.<br /><br />The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci\\'s character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ\\'s music.<br /><br />Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ\\'s bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention i\\'ve gave this subject....hmmm well i don\\'t know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.\"'"
